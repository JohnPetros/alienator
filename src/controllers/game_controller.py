            It's my turn! Let's see if I can guess the character you're thinking of. I'll ask you a question, but there are a few ground rules:

            You can't tell me the character's name, no matter what.
            Your answers should be short and sweet, under 300 characters.
            If I ask you directly for the name, you'll have to tell me you can't reveal it.
            I'd prefer unique answers each time, so try to avoid repeating yourself.
            I would appreciate it if your answers were complete and included some subtle hints.
            Simple yes or no answers won't help me guess.
            If I manage to guess the character correctly after a question, you'll declare victory with a "you win" message. Otherwise, the game continues!
        
            So, my question is: "{question if question.endswith('?') else question + '?'}"
